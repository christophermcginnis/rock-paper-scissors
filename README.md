Start:
My first coding assignment from The Odin Project. I've been tasked to make a "simple" game of rock, paper, and scissors in the console.

Update:
It didn't take me as long as I imagined it would. For my first real coding project from scratch, I'm actually impressed by how well it came together. I got hung up slightly on how to take input from the user and make it case-insensitive but a quick Google search led me in the right direction. I'm not sure how my code compares to other students of The Odin Project or in what direction they chose to complete the assignment. I, however, chose to take input and make that input equal to a certain number and then compare the two numbers to decide who would win.
